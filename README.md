# CRUD Backend API using FastAPI

This repository contains a fully functional backend API built using **FastAPI**. The API performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users and posts and implements authentication mechanisms using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The project is designed as a generalized template and can be modified to suit various application needs.
